<h2>Exit Strategy Services</h2>
<p>
  Successful businesses start with a sound <strong>Business Plan</strong>
 and grow with <strong>Strategic Planning</strong>. Yet most business owners don’t have a formal <strong>Exit Strategy</strong>.
</p>
<p>
 An Exit Strategy will help you exit your business on your terms! Many business owners
 exit their businesses due to one of the “5 Ds” – Death, Disability, Divorce, Distress and
 Disagreement. The 5 Ds can happen to anyone. Without an Exit Strategy, such an exit
 would not be on your terms.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>An Exit Strategy is designed to:</strong><br><br>
                  • Give you control over how and when to exit<br>
                  • Maximize the value of your business<br>
                  • Minimize taxes.<br>
</p>
<p>
Exiting a business is complicated and involves issues and challenges that vary greatly from those associated with operating
the business. Accordingly, most business owners need outside help to create a sound Exit Strategy.
</p>
<p>
Each business is unique! Durant Business Advisors recognizes that fact. Accordingly, we will develop a tailored proposal
for your business from the high-level outline of our exit planning process.
