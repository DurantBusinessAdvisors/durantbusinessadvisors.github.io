##Commercial Mediation and Arbitration Services

Litigation is an expensive distraction no management team can afford in today’s competitive
environment. We offer alternative dispute resolution services – mediation
and arbitration – for commercial disputes. Alternative dispute resolution
can result in significant savings in both time and money as well as help
to maintain commercial relationships that can sour during the course of
contentious litigation.

**Mediation** is a voluntary method of alterative dispute resolution that allows parties to craft their own solution to a dispute.
In mediation, we serve as an unbiased third party (the mediator) to assist the parties in the process by conducting private
interviews and negotiations with each party to discuss settlement opportunities and facilitate an agreeable solution.

**Arbitration** is a faster, simpler and less expensive alternative to litigation. In Arbitration, we would serve as a neutral third
party (the arbitrator). After carefully reviewing all of the relevant information, we would issue a final decision in favor of
one of the parties. Arbitration offers parties a decisive outcome to their dispute without the expense and inconvenience of
court proceedings.

Like many mediators and arbitrators, Mr. Durant is a licensed attorney. What sets him apart is decades of operating
businesses, large and small, which gives him an unique perspective that allows him to truly understand the issues facing the
parties and work with them to solve their disputes short of expensive and time consuming litigation.

Mr. Durant has been a licensed attorney and a member of the American Bar Association since 1989. He has received both
Certified Civil Mediation training and Certified Civil Arbitration training and is a Minnesota Rule 114 Qualified Neutral.
